K-mer: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-mer
k-mers are subsequences of length k contained within a biological sequence.

Biological sequence: Sequences of nucleotides or amino acids.

Nucleotide: An organic molecule that is the building block of DNA and RNA
It has five Nitrogen bases: Adenine, Cytosine, Guanine, Thymine, Urasil

DNA: Deoxyribonucleic acid. Adenine, Cytosine, Guanine, Thymine (A, C, G, T)
RNA: Ribonucleic acid. Adenine, Guanine, Thymine, Uracil (A, C, T, U)

Example:
    Biological Sequence: TAGACTGTC
    K-mer of length 5: TAGAC, AGACT, GACTG
    
    For DNAs, number of k-mers for length k = 4^k
    number of k-mers for length 5 = 4 ^ 5
