Global Alignment is a method of finding similarity regions of two sequences.
In this method, sequences are comapred from beginning to end.

Example:
  Suppose, value for match = +1
                     mismatch = -1
  Sequence 1: ATCGA
  Sequence 2: AACTG
  
  Here we have +1 -1 +1 -1 -1 = -1
  This is the global alignment method and -1 is the similarity score.
  
  

Needleman-Wunsch Similarity Score is a standard method for measuring similarity between two sequences.
In the paper, cosine similarities are comapred with NW score. Experiments prove that NW score and 
cosine similarity of k-mers are positively correlated. Which means both scores same direction e move
